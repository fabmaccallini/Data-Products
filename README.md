Data-Products
=============

The application built as an assignemnt for the Data Products course is called "Play with thte Central Limit Theorem".
If you are not familiar with the theorem a quick definition is given in the application.  

The application gives the opportunity to empirically verify that the sample means are approximatelly normally distributed, for different type of distributions (with well defined mean and varinace): *Binomial, Exponential, Gamma, Lognormal, Normal, Poisson, Uniform*, and for diffenret sample sizes. The number of simulations is set to 1,000 but it can be changed (up to 10,000).  
The histogram of the sample means in the main panel is reactive to changes in the distribution type, sample size, simulations and. By activating/deactivatin the tick box a normal probability density function can be added/removed to/from the histogram.  
In the side panel we check that the proportion of sample means follow the 68-95-97.3 rule, that is to say that the proportion of the sample means with 1, 2, 3 standard deviations is respectively 68%, 95%, 97.3%.
